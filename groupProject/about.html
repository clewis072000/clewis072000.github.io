                <p>
                    Hi there, my name is Nick Boutross and I am a senior here at North Carolina A&T. I plan to graduate in December of this year. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Currently, I works in telecommunications and previously worked in the biopharaceutical industry. 
                    Prior to starting my professional career, I served in the United States Marine Corps for 5 years obtaining the rank of sergeant. 
                    I spent 2 years of that service in Okinawa Japan with a tour to South Korea and the remainder in Cherry Point NC where I had 1 tour to Afghanistan.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I have been married for nearly seven years to my loving wife who is constantly pushing me forward. 
                    I spend my time away from the computer at parks, in the yard, or on a trail, usually with my phone in hand to take pictures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On nights without assignment work to accomplish I like to play Destiny, but those nights are few and far between with other committments. 
                </p>
